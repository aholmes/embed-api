Please reference http://confluence.mtvi.com/display/BROADBANDMEDIA/Embed+API for API usage.

Documentation:
http://media.mtvnservices.com/player/api/docs/

To run the Embed API test page from the project root:
$ node test 

Then visit http://localhost:3131

Using this page is an easy way to work on the main source file (src/index.js) while testing the app.

There are also buster unit tests:
$ buster-test -c test/buster/buster.js
